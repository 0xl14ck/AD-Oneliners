Enumeration

find hidden files
find . -type f -name '*.py'  <----you can edit this to find php, py, html, txt, whatever file you want.

---------------------------
Find writeable files in a linux box IE, if you want to download an exploit etc etc

find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null      # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-writeable folders
find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-writeable folders

find / -perm -o x -type d 2>/dev/null     # world-executable folders

find / \( -perm -o w -perm -o x \) -type d 2>/dev/null   # world-writeable & executable folders

find / -perm -2 ! -type l -ls 2>/dev/null  # world readable and writeable folders - maybe a cron job running as root :)

find / -type f -exec grep -l "flag.txt" {} \;  ##Find a file with a particular name

---------------------------

find filtering by path, filename, and permissions

find /path -iname "FILTER" -perm PERM

find with flags used to list or delete files found

find /path -iname "FILTER" -ls

find with grep to quickly identify files of interest

find /path -iname "FILTER" -exec grep -i "CONTENT" {} \;

find things like shadow.bak etc

find / -iname "shadow*"

find with flags used to list or delete files found (w/error redirection)
find / -iname "shadow*" -ls 2>/dev/null  

find results can also be filtered by file permissions as well (-perm) flag
find / -iname "shadow*" -perm /o+r -ls 2>/dev/null  

find with grep to search for strings inside of files:
find /home -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec grep -i 'pass' {} \;  

find with grep to quickly identify files of interest:
find /home -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec grep -li 'pass' {} \;  

find with egrep to quickly identify files of interest using regular expressions:
find /home -iname "*.txt" 2>/dev/null -exec egrep -li "^.+@.+$" {} \;  

Syntax: Recursively list all hidden files and directories on Linux/Unix

The basic syntax is as follows:

find /dir/to/search/ -name ".*" -print

OR

find /dir/to/search/ -name ".*" -ls

OR search only hidden files:

find /dir/to/search/ -type f -iname ".*" -ls

OR search only hidden directories:

find /dir/to/search/ -type d -iname ".*" -ls

OR

find /dir/to/search -path '*/.*' -print
find /dir/to/search -path '*/.*' -ls

Find files based in attributes e.g.; list files that are text, ascii, unicode etc etc

file /home/bandit4/inhere/*

Find a readable file, that is not executable, and has a certain size (within same directory)

find -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
