Generating Valid Certificates - 

https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/debianother-other


If you have a valid domain and access to the webserver e.g., Command Line Access to a Linux Box, do the following

wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
sudo mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chown root /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto

*****Be Sure to set up your webserver and have it running, EFF will verify your site is up and running before giving you a cert.

To obtain a cert using the "webroot" plugin, which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:


# ./certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d domain.com -d subdomain.domain.com  

The previous command will generate a certificate for meterpaderp.com and also the subdomain, subdomain.meterpaderp.com using the webroot /var/www/html - which is the default webroot for apache2
