PAM Trust Enumeration

Using the AD mocule, we can enumerate Trust Properties.  If a trust has a Forest Transitive set to True and SIDFilteringQuarantined set to false (which means that SID Filtering is disabled), it has properties set for PAM trust.

Get-ADTrust -Filter {(ForestTransitive -eq $True) -and (SIDFilteringQuarantined -eq $False)}

To be sure about use of PAM Trust, we can enumerate the shadow security principals.

Get-ADObject -SearchBase ("CN=Shadow Principal Configuration,CN=Services," + (Get-ADRootDSE).configurationNamingContext) -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,member,msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid | fl

To check if we are in a production or user forest, We can filter Forest Trusts

***************Make sure that you have both the Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll and the ActiveDirectory\ActiveDirectory.psd1 modules loaded!!!

Get-ADTrust -Filter {(ForestTransitive -eq $True)}

If TAPT (TRUST_ATTRIBUT_PIM_TRUST) is 0x00000400 (1024 in decimal) for PAM/PIM and TRUST_ATTRIBUTE_TREAT_AS_EXTERNAL (0x00000040) are set, the trust is a PAM Trust

A trust attribute of 1096 is for PAM (0x00000400) and External Trust (0x00000040) and Forest Transitive (0x00000008)


List all computers in domain powershell

Get-DomainComputer | select DNSHOSTNAME

List of users to compromise in order to abuse PAM Trust

Get-ADObject -SearchBase ("CN=Shadow Principal Configuration,CN=Services," + (Get-ADRootDSE).configurationNamingContext) -Filter * -Properties * | select Name,member,msDS-ShadowPrincipalSid | fl

The output will show

1. Name of the shadow principal
2. Members from the bastion forest that are mapped to the shadow principal
3. SID of the principal user or group in the forest whose privileges are assigned to the shadow security principal.
